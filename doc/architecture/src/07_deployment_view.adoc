== Deployment View

=== Production

Motivation::

The production deployment is straight forward. All the building blocks compile to one unix elf executable. As a matter of fact, the GUI part will be deployed as plain text QML description files. Shmoose runs direct on the Sailfish OS Smart-phone and has to connect to an external XMPP Server.

=== Development and testing

Motivation::

With a runnable executable on a desktop environment, one is able to use all the fancy develop and debugging tools. Shmoose is structured in a way that a deployment on any Linux OS is possible.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

To be able to use a full featured desktop development system is quit useful to reduce the round trips of coding, building and deploying to the target systems. This also allows to setup a testing system which tests Shmoose on the outer interfaces.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::

Two instances of Shmoose are running on the Linux System. On both clients, the GUI part is dropped in favour of a dbus interface. Almost all functionality which was accessible through the GUI is now reachable through the dbus interface. Each clients announce his interface on the dbus session bus. The Testrunner connects to each of the clients interfaces. After that, the Testrunner calls both clients through dbus to connect to the XMPP Server, which also runs on the same Linux System. With this setup, any functionality in a Shmoose client can be triggered and checked for reaction on the other hand side Shmoose client.

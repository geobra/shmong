== Building Block View

The GUI part will be implemented in QML. This allows a loosely coupled graphical interface from the rest of the implementation. On Sailfish OS, there is a proprietary QML extension named silica. This QML extension is not available on other platforms. Because of this, the GUI part has to be developed separately for different target devices which is possible without touching or even recompiling the rest of the source code.

https://swift.im/swiften/api/[Swiften], the main library used by Shmoose is responsible to handle most of the XMPP protocol details.

https://github.com/gkdr/libomemo[Libomemo] and https://github.com/gkdr/axc[axc] are used to be able to implement the https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html[OMEMO XEP] and are mainly responsible to implement the E2E security details.

The client part puts all the pieces together and makes heavy use of the https://www.qt.io/download-open-source[Qt library].


=== Whitebox Overall System

The whitebox description will mainly concentrate on the 'Client' part, described in the 'Building Block View'. The used librarys Qt and Swiften are accessed from many components in different classes, wheres libomemo and axc are only used in the accordingly OmemoHandler implementation.

The following diagram is a decomposition of the 'Client' implementation.

The GUI part consists of several QML files, one for each page. It uses a classic Model-View-Controler pattern and will not be discussed in more detail here.

Motivation::

The overall client part is seperated in functional parts as well as in implementation of different XEP's which are not proviced by the swiften library.

Contained Building Blocks::

* base: Implementation of basic functionality like advertising client capabilities or message handling
* persistence: Implementations to store send and received data
* xep: Different implementations for missing functionality in the used xmpp library
* networkconnection: SFOS specific implementation for handling (re)connections on a mobile device
* contacts: Handling of xmpp contacts (aka roster)
* room: Implementation for handling and joining groups
